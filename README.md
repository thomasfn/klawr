Klawr (Experimental WIP)
========================
A set of Unreal Engine 4 plugins that will allow users to write game-play code in C# (and eventually
other CLI languages such as F#), in game projects targeting the Windows platform. If you're looking
for a cross-platform alternative Xamarin has developed a [plugin](https://mono-ue.github.io/) that
provides Mono integration, however a commercial Mono license is not cheap, and it doesn't work in
newer UE versions. The primary aim of this project is to make it possible to do anything that can
currently be done in Blueprints in C# scripts, in order to eliminate the need for complex Blueprint
spaghetti.

The current development focus is on script components (see `UKlawrScriptComponent`), these are
actor components whose functionality is implemented in a C# class. The C# class attached to a
script component can access any Blueprint accessible property or function exposed by the actor it
is attached to or any of its sibling components (this is still limited at present since only a
subset of all the possible property types is supported). Eventually the properties and methods
defined in a C# script component will also be exposed to Blueprints.

Some time was also spent developing script objects, which allow for "subclassing" in C# of almost
any `UObject` derived class, actors included, but that's currently on the back-burner.

NOTE: This project is still highly experimental, and not very useful (though it's getting there).

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/enlight/klawr/wiki) for additional details.

Prerequisites
=============
- Windows 7 or later
- Unreal Engine 4.14 or later (you'll need the source from GitHub)
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later

Overview
========
Klawr consists of one native C++ library, a couple of C# assemblies, and three UE4 plugins.

The core of the CLR hosting code is located in the **Klawr.ClrHost** libraries. The
**Klawr.ClrHost.Native** C++ library bootstraps the CLR, and the C# assemblies handle hosting
related tasks and provide some core classes for use by the auto-generated UE4 C# API (as well
as user scripts). **Klawr.ClrHost.Native** is linked into **KlawrRuntimePlugin**, which allows
Unreal Engine to load and execute assemblies containing managed code.

**KlawrCodeGeneratorPlugin** generates C# wrappers for `UObject` subclasses from the reflection
information gathered by the **Unreal Header Tool (UHT)** from `UFUNCTION` and `UPROPERTY`
decorators in the engine/game source. This is the same reflection information that underpins much
of the functionality provided by Blueprints.

**KlawrRuntimePlugin** executes user scripts written in C#, scripts have access to the wrapped UE4
API generated by **KlawrCodeGeneratorPlugin**.

**KlawrEditorPlugin** provides a new Blueprint type that can be used to create actor components
that are implemented in managed assemblies.

Building
========
This is a two phase process, in the first phase the CLR hosting libraries must be built, in the
second phase the plugins themselves.

Source Location
---------------
The directory hierarchy of this repository matches that of the UE4 source repository, once you
check out this project you can just copy the Engine directory into your UE4 source checkout and
everything should end up in the right place. However, if you plan on making any changes to the
source you'll probably want create a couple of directory junctions instead of copy/pasting
files back and forth. To that end I've provided `CreateLinks.bat`, which you can right-click
on and `Run as administrator` directly from the checkout root. The batch file will prompt you
to enter the path to the UE4 source checkout that you'd like to use to build Klawr, and will then
create the necessary directory junctions.

Now everything should be in the right place, from here on any paths are relative to the UE4 source
checkout.

Libraries
---------
1. Open `Engine\Source\ThirdParty\Klawr\Klawr.ClrHost.sln` in VS2015.
2. Set the `Solution Configuration` to either `Release` or `Debug`.
3. Set the `Solution Platform` to `x64` (this is very important, Win32 builds are not supported yet).
4. Select `Build Solution` to build all the libraries.

Assuming that the build finished with no errors you can move on to phase two.

Custom configuration (Optionally)
-------
1. Optionaly Configure Klawr code generator plugin to include and exclude modules or files from beeing processed.
   You will find the config file at "Engine/Plugins/Klawr/Klawr/Resources/Config.ini".
   This is how this file might look like.
   
    [Config]
    ScriptExcludedModules=ScriptPlugin
    ScriptExcludedModules=ScriptEditorPlugin
    ScriptExcludedModules=ScriptGeneratorPlugin
    ScriptExcludedModules=KlawrRuntimePlugin
    ScriptSupportedModules=CoreUObject
    ScriptSupportedModules=Engine

Using
=====
First of all make sure you've got a project open that you don't mind obliterating in case something
goes wrong, next enable KlawrRuntimePlugin and KlawrEditorPlugin in UnrealEd, restart as requested.

Now you can [create a script component Blueprint](https://github.com/enlight/klawr/wiki/Creating-a-Script-Component-Blueprint).
